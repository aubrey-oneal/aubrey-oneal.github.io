              Teams that consistently deliver quality products and meet user
              needs are considered 'unicorns' in the tech industry. At IBM, a
              framework of design thinking is one of the key ingredients of such
              teams, and design thinking coaches are the people who guide teams
              towards excellence. But how can a business with more than 350,000
              employees and hundreds of products scale quality coaches?<br /><br />In
              this project, I worked with two designers to enabl emerging design
              thinking coaches through access to education, mentorship, and
              opportunities to practice coaching. Coaches now represent a more
              diverse number of locations, languages, and disciplines at IBM.
              The community is scaling while maintaining a high standard.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-light">
              Over the course of a year, I wore many hats on this project: I
              conducted research on emerging, delayed, and model coaches. I
              managed media and content production, created working prototypes,
              and helped manage our sponsor user pilot programs. Today, I lead
              the global coach review board, a group of highly experienced
              design thinkers from 24 countries.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-light">
              Though we had 550 coaches in over 24 countries, we knew that 43%
              were in the United States—and many of those coaches were also from
              a design background. We knew there were many corners of IBM where
              we could drive human-centered outcomes if we created coaches in
              those areas (i.e. in India where IBM was rapidly growing its
              workforce). We recognized that there was some low-hanging fruit we
              could solve with some basic logistics and expectation-setting.
              More importantly, we needed to provide longitudinal training and
              clearly articulate the value of becoming a coach. Or, as I like to
              call it, the 'WIIFM'— What's In It For Me. We could also provide
              structure, chunking down the development of skills into manageable
              portions. And we could provide tactical guidance such as
              real-world strategies for tricky situations.
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-light">
              After researching our users and developing an initial curriculum,
              I hosted two in-person workshops. This provided the curriculum
              team with a testing ground and jumpstarted 40 design thinkers
              towards the path of becoming a coach. From the feedback we
              received, it was clear participants wanted deeper content and more
              of it. We then moved to a seven-week, virtual course to dive into
              deeper content, while also testing if it was possible to scale the
              number of people who could deliver this course in the future.
              Through a cohort model, we curated a sense of
              community—participants advised each other, reviewed applications,
              and even posted coaching opportunities. We also learned that the
              size of the cohort dramatically impacted the engagement; 12 worked
              great, 20 not-so-much.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-light">
              The cohort model, while effective, was not scalable, so we took
              the deep content we had developed—and our many lessons-learned—and
              developed scalable online content. We focused on providing
              guidance, real-world case studies, and templates for documenting
              small-wins and showing iteration. This meant we had a few
              different types of content such as a workbook, case-study videos,
              small-wins, and more. “Today, I have enrolled in this course and
              while going through the first module, I realized, these lessons
              can be applied to any work that involves more than 2-3 people! I
              can use these pointers in my day-to-day work where I have to deal
              with multiple teams. I plan to apply these skills in my work and
              then apply for this badge! Kudos to the team for finally giving us
              a simple yet practical program!” - Emerging CoachWe evaluated
              success through interviews and surveys—and by comparing applicants
              who took the course versus those who did not.There was an
              improvement, but not as much as we wanted. So we returned to our
              research and doubled down on a fact we'd been dancing around: the
              most successful applicants had a mentor to provide guidance or a
              sponsor to give them coaching opportunities.In response, we
              rapidly prototyped a platform to connect emerging coaches with
              mentors and to consolidate opportunities. This MVP was rolled out
              to 70 emerging coaches in a pilot program that was highly
              successful. We are steadily developing a stream of high quality
              applicants from additional countries and backgrounds.

              Today, I'm the lead of coach review board, a group of EDT coaches
              from 24 countries who evaluate coach applications and provide
              feedback. My journey to get to this point took about two years.I
              started small, volunteering for low-stakes facilitation
              opportunities, like leading IBM's new hires through their first
              two-day-experience of design thinking. I gathered feedback from
              these sessions to reflect and improve.<br /><br />Next, I
              volunteered to be a scribe for a higher-stakes engagement, the
              Future of Design Education Work Group. This group of high-profile
              academics, educators, and industry designers needed help learning
              to collaborate in a remote setting, so I took the time to teach
              them Mural and helped facilitate their early sessions.Along the
              way, there were many small moments of coaching on my own team, but
              I felt that because we were all in the design thinking scene, I
              needed to find a challenge.<br /><br />I volunteered to coach for
              three intensive programs: IBM's summer internship program, a new
              hire design training program, and a developer training program.
              After this experience, I had the eminence to begin leading design
              thinking initiatives on my as a guest facilitator for various
              product teams.<br /><br />Now at IBM my focus is on supporting the
              review board and ensuring that applicants continue to feel
              supported with resources and mentors.
