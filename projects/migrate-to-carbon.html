              In 2022 and 2023, IBM acquired at least 16 new products
              specializing in data management, artificial intelligence, and
              hybrid cloud computing. Integrating these products into the IBM
              portfolio required adopting the Carbon Design System to ensure a
              cohesive brand and user experience. Using Carbon guarantees that
              products meet IBM's high accessibility standards—exceeding WCAG
              guidelines—which is essential for securing U.S. federal contracts.
              Furthermore, by reducing redundant design and development work,
              Carbon significantly cuts costs.
              <a
                href="https://sparkbox.com/foundry/design_system_roi_impact_of_design_systems_business_value_carbon_design_system"
                class="link"
                >One study</a
              >
              found that using Carbon made the creation of a simple form page
              47% faster to develop versus coding it from scratch.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-light">
              Due to my experience as a product designer on the Carbon team as
              well as a strong track record of developing educational content at
              IBM, I was tasked with designing a 'Carbon migration playbook' and
              aiding product teams Databand, Polar, Envizi, Instana, and Randori
              with their migrations, to varying degrees of involvement. I
              developed a migration playbook and personally implemented it with
              Databand before scaling it to other teams.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-light">
              I began my project by interviewing several teams transitioning to
              Carbon, gathering insights to identify best practices and
              challenges. My interviews revealed that teams needed clarity on
              why Carbon is necessary and how it benefits their product. Many
              teams struggle to audit their existing UI components to determine
              which have direct Carbon equivalents and which require
              modification. In fact, several product teams I worked with did not
              have a design system at all. Additionally, teams must balance
              Carbon migration with ongoing feature development, ensuring
              accessibility compliance while also dealing with technical debt
              and potential re-architecture challenges. Practices that led teams
              towards migrating to Carbon included:<br />‍<br />- Clear
              communication early in the acquisition process that Carbon
              migration is a priority, with a focus on its importance from both
              user and business perspectives.<br />- Strong collaboration
              between project managers, designers, and developers to create a
              migration plan.<br />- A designer skilled in quickly mapping
              Carbon assets to the existing product in Figma, enabling early
              feasibility discussions with developers.<br />- A strategy to
              prioritize migrating smaller components—such as typography,
              colors, icons, toggles, buttons, text inputs, dropdowns, and page
              headers—before tackling larger components like the data table in
              later phases.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-light">
              I created a website called “Migrate to Carbon”, which guides teams
              through activities to develop a phased roadmap. The three key
              activities I designed are: an asset audit, accessibility audit,
              and migration sizing. The asset audit maps current UI components
              to Carbon components, while the accessibility audit evaluates
              compliance and highlights areas for improvement. Migration sizing
              is used to estimate development effort and plan a phased rollout.
              Breaking migration into manageable phases helps teams integrate
              Carbon incrementally while keeping product development on track.
              Phase 1 focuses on aligning branding elements like fonts, colors,
              icons, and form elements. Phase 2 emphasizes implementing core and
              custom components while ensuring accessibility compliance.
              Finally, Phase 3 refines user experience, implements data
              visualization, and achieves full accessibility compliance. This
              structured framework enables teams to adopt Carbon methodically,
              while customizing their approach according to team capabilities
              and complexity of the product.

            <div class="paragraph-light">
              Right after the launch of the migration playbook, IBM acquired
              Databand, a data observability platform based in Tel Aviv. I
              introduced myself to the team and presented the value of Carbon,
              and gained initial buy-in from designers. This introduction also
              allowed me to learn about the unique features of their product and
              the release deadlines they were managing.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-light">
              Databand product did not have a design system in Figma, so I
              offered to do the component audit. I systematically documented
              their product's elements, including type tokens, color tokens,
              icons, and statuses, as well as the majority of their components,
              and mapped them to Carbon equivalents using the audit templates I
              had created in the playbook. Along the way, I conducted an
              accessibility assessment that highlighted both minor and major
              issues that needed attention. For instance, their product
              frequently used popovers with interactive elements. A more
              appropriate solution was to replace these with toggle tips,
              allowing for improved keyboard navigation and screen reader
              access. The third activity, migration sizing, required developers
              from both Databand and Carbon to come together in a workshop, and
              the result was a clear timeline based on their team size and
              capabilities. These efforts put the team on track to complete
              phases 1 of their migration. They are completing phase 2, which
              involves more complex user flows and addressing components that
              don't have a Carbon equivalent.

              After my collaboration with Databand, I moved on to other
              projects, and teams had to independently use the migration
              activities. However, teams were moving at a slower pace than
              anticipated, and it became evident that having a Carbon expert to
              guide them through the process would improve time to migration. To
              further accelerate Carbon adoption, IBM is investing in a
              dedicated 12-person team in Dublin, Ireland, to perform the tasks
              I mentioned above.

              Through this work, I developed scalable educational materials for
              Carbon migration, helped multiple acquisition teams streamline

              product migration strategy, and influenced IBM's decision to
              expand migration support with a dedicated team.
