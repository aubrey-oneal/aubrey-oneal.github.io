              While the Carbon Design System served as the “core” library,
              dozens of local systems emerged over the years to meet specific
              product needs. These libraries were valuable but introduced style
              inconsistencies, asset duplication, and siloed workflows.
              Designers and developers often had to dig through multiple systems
              to find usable components, and there was no unified way to
              discover or contribute assets. Our team set out to solve this:
              create a platform where IBM makers could find, use, and contribute
              standardized design assets and code libraries—all in one place.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-light">
              I worked across disciplines to bring the Carbon Platform to life.
              I led user research, contributed both low and high-fidelity
              designs, wrote front-end code for the platform itself, and helped
              create a schema to index assets. This work was highly
              cross-functional, requiring deep collaboration with designers,
              developers, and library maintainers across the company.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-light">
              I started with foundational research. I led interviews and
              usability studies with internal IBM teams to understand how they
              searched for assets, what barriers they encountered, and what a
              “source of truth” would mean to them. These insights revealed a
              strong need for standardization, clearer taxonomy, and better
              tooling to support discovery and governance. The research directly
              informed our core platform structure and the asset schema we later
              developed.

            <div class="paragraph-light">
              From there, I moved into prototyping and interface design. Early
              explorations focused on how to surface the right information at
              the right time—balancing depth of content with discoverability. I
              designed filtering patterns, content layouts, and taxonomy labels
              that made it easier for users to browse and evaluate assets.

            <div class="paragraph-light">
              I tested design directions with users using varied methods. For
              example, how quickly and easily a user could find a specific asset
              that met all their requirements. I refined the experience based on
              what they needed to trust and implement the assets they found.

              On the development side, I helped build core features of the
              platform, including the asset catalog interface and schema-driven
              rendering logic. I helped develop a tagging structure powered
              search and filtering, and contributed to our live indexing system
              that keeps platform content current and version-aware. I also
              helped migrate documentation from carbondesignsystem.com,
              enhancing it with richer metadata and clearer pathways between
              core and local systems.

              A key outcome of this work I want to highlight was a shared schema
              for indexing assets. I collaborated with library maintainers to
              define asset metadata and governance standards. This schema now
              powers how assets are categorized, displayed, and versioned across
              the platform—and has enabled us to scale from a handful of
              libraries to over 250 assets from more than 10 teams.
