          <p class="paragraph-2">Aubrey is an incredible designer who excels in so many areas from content, UX, to systems thinking. She facilitated a workshop for the Carbon design system last year and was able to rally our leaders from different parts of the organization to bring meaningful discussion and alignment across our design system. She has a unique ability to distill complicated aspects of our design system — and local systems — and bring clarity to our information architecture within the greater design system.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-2">I had the pleasure of working with Aubrey in IBM&#x27;s Design Program office, where we collaborated on a course to help teams thoughtfully integrate AI into their products. Aubrey is an incredible teammate—creative, a strong writer, and a joy to work with. Her ability to organize complex ideas into accessible content is evident in the impactful work she&#x27;s doing to help product teams adopt IBM&#x27;s design system. </p>

Her familiarity with design systems and the personas that use them combined with her practice in applying design thinking give her so much insight into how to lead projects in a way that’s effective and impactful.

          <p class="paragraph-2">Aubrey has been an absolute gift to the Carbon team and continues to tackle some of the hairiest inconsistencies and docs debt on the Carbon website. She’s also beloved and trusted by the Carbon System Squad and the larger Carbon community. In fact, she’s the only person who’s been able to get the Carbon devs engaged in site content and component taxonomy. Without their involvement, we never could’ve pulled off a standardized naming convention across the website, Figma and storybook. I can’t emphasize enough that Aubrey’s success is directly proportional to the trust she’s been able to build with the team and the community as someone who truly listens. Everything Aubrey puts forward, no matter how complex, is thoroughly researched and concisely played back to elicit feedback from the widest possible audience.</p>

She guided our new team of six software engineers to quickly develop a successful proof-of-concept in an efficient manner. Aubrey is very resourceful and was able to connect our team with internal and external sources to answer any questions we had about our development project while simultaneously assisting her own team. It is clear Aubrey stays up-to-date on the latest news in the quantum computing space, and this tenacity combined with her design thinking skills makes her an incredible asset to any development team.&quot;</p>

          <p class="paragraph-2">Aubrey is unique in bringing both a rock solid UX background and content design experience. The Carbon Design System team leans on Aubrey to simplify complexity, whether that’s the language on a page, the design on a screen, or the information architecture of an entire website. She truly shines when she’s guiding initiatives at scale. In working together on daunting initiatives, such as an extensive website redesign, she was able to break down and scope the work so that the team had a clear path forward. Aubrey is the rare designer that can manage and guide a project at that scale, while also submitting and reviewing the code that goes out. <br><br>Aubrey is an excellent collaborator and communicator. I love being in design critiques with her because she always asks thoughtful questions that get to the heart of the user’s challenges. She works tirelessly to loop in users and SMEs to get the whole story, and she has a knack breaking down complexity and user needs until it is understandable. She is a joy to work alongside, and her impact is felt across Carbon Design system and the design community at IBM.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-2">I&#x27;ve had the privilege of working with Aubrey as a peer and teammate, and seeing her grow and evolve as her manager. Through every experience I&#x27;ve had with her, she&#x27;s demonstrated unlimited curiosity and a strong growth mindset. From content expertise, quantum technology, design systems, to user experience design, I see no bounds to Aubrey&#x27;s ability to learn quickly and build new skills and interests, which makes her a asset to any team she joins. As one of her former managers, I&#x27;ve considered Aubrey a reliable, talented, and self-sufficient employee and one that I would hire over and over again.</p>
